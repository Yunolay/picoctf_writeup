## Description

There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 21135, but it doesn't speak English...

## Hints

1. You can practice using netcat with this picoGym problem: what's a netcat?
2. You can practice reading and writing ASCII with this picoGym problem: Let's Warm Up

## Solve

```bash
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 21135
112
105
99
111
67
84
70
123
103
48

```

This looks like an ASCII character code. Write a simple solver in python.

```python
num =[112, 105, 99, 111, 67, 84, 70, 123, 103, 48, 48, 100, 95, 107, 49, 116, 116, 121, 33, 95, 110, 49, 99, 51, 95, 107, 49, 116, 116, 121, 33, 95, 97, 102, 100, 53, 102, 100, 97, 52, 125, 10]

print(''.join(chr(i) for i in num))
```

Run the script and we will get the flag.

```bash
$ python3 solve.py        
picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_********}
```

## Flag

```
picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_********}
```
